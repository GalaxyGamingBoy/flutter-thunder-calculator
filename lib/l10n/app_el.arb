  "helpParagraphA": "This is a simple app I made that calculates the distance of a lighting strike, by measuring the time it takes you to hear the thunder by the time you see it. For you to calculate the distance you have 2 ways.",
  "helpParagraphB": "The first is to click the \"Start\" button on the stopwatch when you see the lighting and click \"Stop & Record Time\" when you hear the sound. You should have the distance shown in the bottom.",
  "helpParagraphC": "The second one is to count yourself the time it takes from the moment you see the thunder to the moment you hear it. After counting the seconds or minutes, input it on the \"TIME MEASURED\" section. You should have the distance shown in the bottom.",
